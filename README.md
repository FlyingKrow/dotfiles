Before start ***make sure you backup your previous config files!***

To install - clone this repo to some temp folder (like ~/.tmp/) by this command and follow simple steps:

`git clone https://github.com/FlyingKrow/dotfiles ~/.tmp/fdots`

1. `cd ~/.tmp/fdots`
2. `chmod +x install.sh`
3. `./install.sh`

### It's not full install!

If you want to use my .zshrc configuration, then copy `./zsh/zshrc` to your home directory manually
